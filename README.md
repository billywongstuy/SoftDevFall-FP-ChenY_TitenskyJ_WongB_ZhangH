On the home page, you have the option to view a post or create a post.

Once you click the create post button, you can create the post inputting a language, title, and text. There will be a on-screen keyboard depending on the language chosen to make typing in different languages more convenient.

If you decide to click on a post to view it, you have the option to add a comment or edit.

You can add a comment to give the poster praise or feedback. Or you can add an edit to revise the post for the poster to see. The text will automatically be filled into the box when you choose to edit so you don't have to copy and paste. The language keyboard will also be present when you edit/comment.

As the poster, you can view all of your posts on your account page. From there, you can click on the posts to see if you received any edits or comments. You can also change your language preferences on your account page.
